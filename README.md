# SolarSystem
A Orbit and Solar System simulation

This project was something I started over the winter break in effort to help learn Python. I was inspired by someone doing something similar in C# on youtube and I thought I would be able to pull this off in (to me) a new language. There are sliders to adjust the strength of gravity, simulation speed, trail length, as well as a play/pause button.
